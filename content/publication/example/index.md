abstract: For over a decade, scholars of European studies have been studying a
  phenomenon referred to as the politicization of the European Union, usually
  defined as the intensification of a political debate, the polarization of
  opinions, and public resonance. This article extends existing explanatory
  models by offering a systematic theorization of the role emotions in EU
  politicization to establish that emotions are integral to every step of the
  process. First, they are prerequisites as actors and audiences need to be
  emotionally invested in an issue to engage in a debate about it. Second, they
  are drivers since they fuel debates and allow them to get heated and
  polarized. Third, they are outcomes since politicization will engender new
  emotional investments and sensitivities. The analytical added value of
  integrating emotions into explanatory models is illustrated through the case
  of the Brexit campaign.

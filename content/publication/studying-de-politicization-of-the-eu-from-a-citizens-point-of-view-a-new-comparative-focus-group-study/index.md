abstract: Whilst the politicization of the EU has been increasingly studied over
  recent years, the analysis has been focusing mainly on political parties and
  media. Thus, although not completely overlooked, studies looking at EU
  politicization amongst individuals remain scarce. This article presents a new
  qualitative dataset from 21 focus groups conducted across social groups and
  four countries. It was designed to observe processes of (de-)politicization at
  citizens’ level, how they talk about the EU and along which cleavages are
  their attitudes structured. This comparative research design sheds new light
  on discourses and opinions on Europe, mechanisms of politicization and
  political discussions.

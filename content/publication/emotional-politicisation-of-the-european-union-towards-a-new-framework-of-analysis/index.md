  Politicisation of European issues in times of crises but this paper challenges
  the

  largely accepted assumption according to which the politicisation of these crises manifests

  itself only through three criteria: an intensification of the debate, a polarisation of opinion

  and an expansion of actors. While implied in this common definition of politicisation,

  emotions are neglected in most of the scholarship on the politicisation of Europe. As

  demonstrated by research on emotions in IR, emotions play an integral role in politics, and

  become most visible and salient in times of crises where they develop a disruptive force that

  uproots political attachments and exposes their emotional nature. Utilising these insights,

  this working paper analyses the German government’s discourse on Europe in the context of

  migration in the years 2015 and 2016. To do so, an emotion discourse analysis is employed

  to investigate the usage of emotional terms and connotations, as well as metaphors,

  comparisons, and analogies. We find a significant shift in emotional vocabulary as the crisis

  progresses and is perceived to be salient and of European dimensions.
